# Foxmail-Password-Recovery

# Guide

1. Exit the `Foxmail`.
2. Open `foxDecode` to decipher the password.

# Notice

Saw a few people wanting this across a forum I frequent. Found an example and made it more simplistic and stealthy. Added automatic grabbing for FoxMail's Dir. Tested with the latest FoxMail only. (As of 11/21/2018.)

Don't sell this.
